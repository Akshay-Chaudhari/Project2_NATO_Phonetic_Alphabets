# Project2_NATO_Phonetic_Alphabets
It is called the "NATO" alphabet because it was standardised by the NATO member countries back in the 1950s to allow accurate exchange of radio messages between air, naval and army forces of all the NATO member nations.
They had to make sure that each chosen word sounded different to the others, and was easily pronounceable by speakers of all the European languages, not just in English.
It is now very widely used by all types of "professional communicators" including air traffic control, the police and other emergency services, shipping, etc and in all types of business.
